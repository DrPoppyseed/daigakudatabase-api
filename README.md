# foris-collegesearch-api

There are two non-compatible versions of the api. The older version is on the main branch, and the newer, on the no-images-setup branch.


- no-images-setup branch is the backend for https://daigakudatabase.com (much faster loading time with D3.js visualisations)
- main branch is the backend for https://foris.netlify.app (super slow initial loading time, but with more information about the colleges included)
